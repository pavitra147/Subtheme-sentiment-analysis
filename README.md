# Subtheme Sentiment Analysis

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that performs sentiment analysis on subthemes within a given dataset of text reviews. The analysis involves several steps including data exploration, preprocessing, subtheme identification, sentiment analysis, and model evaluation.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to identify subthemes within text reviews and analyze their sentiments. The project follows these main steps:

1. *Data Exploration*: Load and inspect the dataset.
2. *Data Preprocessing*: Clean and preprocess the text data.
3. *Subtheme Identification*: Identify subthemes using Named Entity Recognition (NER).
4. *Sentiment Analysis*: Analyze the sentiment of each subtheme using a pre-trained sentiment analysis model.
5. *Model Evaluation*: Evaluate the performance of the sentiment analysis model.
6. *Documentation*: Document the approach and provide a summary of the steps taken.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run the notebook, you need to have the following installed:

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas
- nltk
- transformers

### Notebook Steps

1. *Data Exploration*: Load the dataset and display the first few rows to understand its structure.
2. *Data Preprocessing*: Preprocess the text data by converting to lowercase, removing punctuation, and tokenizing.
3. *Subtheme Identification*: Extract subthemes from the text using NER.
4. *Sentiment Analysis*: Apply sentiment analysis to each subtheme using a pre-trained model from the transformers library.
5. *Model Evaluation*: Evaluate the model's performance (placeholder for actual evaluation logic).
6. *Documentation*: Document the approach and summarize the findings.
